Course: Distributed Systems

Assignment: Web Services

Project: Public Transport Tracker

Description: Web application to track scheduled buses/trams on their route.

Remark: I have included public API keys for HERE and DeLijn APIs. I realise this is not considered good practice but it makes it easier to test my project yourself. I have registered a freemium dummy account for these keys so saturating them does not affect my own personal keys.
